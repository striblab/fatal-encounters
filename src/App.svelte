                Almost all of them were men. Most of those killed were white,
                but Black and American Indian people were killed at a
                disproportionately high rate compared to their share of the
                Minnesota population. The deaths occurred all over Minnesota,
                but there were higher rates of deaths in Minneapolis and St.
                Paul than the cities&rsquo; respective population sizes would
                suggest. Some of those killed were armed, some were unarmed.
                Many were experiencing mental health crises.
